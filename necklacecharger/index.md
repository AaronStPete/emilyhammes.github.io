# Necklace Charger
The necklace charger uses a rechargable battery and wires to turn a small PCB into a piece of jewelry. The clasp contains a battery and a recharge circut and each side of the chain is either a positive or ground wire.
  
# Introduction
One wire (male USB) contains only ground while the other wire contains the positive voltage line. A circuit (tiny heart, tiny snowflake, shamrock, dragonfly etc.) is placed between the two wires. The positive side of the clasp also contains a LiPo battery and a PCB with a recharge circut. The battery is recharged by unplugging/unclasping the necklace and pluging the positive side of the clasp into a cell phone/usb charger.
