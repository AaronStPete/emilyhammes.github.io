# Intro to Arduino Shield
## Introduction
The Intro to Arduino shield is a simple kit which plugs into an Arduino Uno or similar. It includes a button, light sensor (LDR) and red green blue LED. The LED can be controlled as a digitial or an analog output, the button is a digitial input and the sensor is an analog input. 

## Theory
### How Arduino Code is Organized
Arduino codes are often organized in the following way:
1. At the top of the file is an explanation of what the code does. This is written so that people can quickly understand what you are trying to do without reading the whole file. So that the computer does not get confused by this text, the programmer needs to tell the computer to ignore it. We do this by putting it in a comment. Single line comments in the Arduino IDE (Arduino software) begin with //. Multiline comments begin with /* and end with */. Comments are also used within the code to explain confusing parts in words so that they are easy to understand a year later.

### Materials
  * 3 220 ohm resistors
  * 1 10K ohm resistor
  * 1 RGB LED
  * 1 Light Dependant Resistor (LDR)
  * male pin header
  
### To solder the shield follow these steps:
  1. Solder the 220 ohm resistors to the R-red R-green and R-blue pads.
  
  2. Cut the leads on all of the LEDs to 2.5-3mm.
  3. Solder 1 side of each of the LEDs, making sure that the flat side of the LED matches the flat side on the silkscreen. I usually do the Square pin first.
  4. Align the LEDs by remelting the solder and moving the LED into place.
  5. Once aligned, solder the other pins on the LEDs. 
  6. Solder cut and solder the pin header.
  
 Â Note: Some people like to leave the leads long and bend them to hold them in place before soldering. Then they trim them after soldering. This is not recommended for this project because it makes alignment and replacement of LEDs difficult or impossible.

### Uploading Code 
* Download the [Arduino software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
* Select Arduino Uno under Tools > Baord in the Arduino software
* Select the correct comport under Tools > Port in the Arduino software
* Copy the code from the bottom of each video and paste into the Arduino IDE
* Click on the arrow symbol in the Arduino IDE
