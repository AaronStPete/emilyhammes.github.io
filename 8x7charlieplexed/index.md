# 8x7 Charlieplexed LED Shield
## Introduction
The 8x7 Charlieplexed Shield contains 56 LEDs in a 8x7 matrix and plugs into 8 adjcient pins on a microcontroler such as an Arduino Pro Mini or an Arduino Nano. By controling the state of the pins all LEDs can be individually turned on or off.

### Materials
  8 resistors
  56 LEDs
  8 pin female pin header
  
### To solder the shield follow these steps:
  1. Solder the resistors.
  2. Cut the leads on all of the LEDs to 2.5-3mm.
  3. Solder 1 side of each of the LEDs, making sure that the flat side of the LED matches the flat side on the silkscreen.
  4. Align the LEDs by remelting the solder and moving the LED into place.
  5. Once aligned, solder the other side of the LEDs. 
  6. Solder the female pin header.
  
    Note: Some people like to leave the leads long and bend them to hold them inplace before soldering. Then they trim them after soldering. This is not reccomended for this project because it makes alignment and replacement of LEDs difficult or impossible. 
    
## The Laser Cut Case 
### Soldering the Arduino Nano
1. Solder the pin headers onto the arduino nano so that the pins point up on the same side as the USB. 
Note: this is the opposite side to what is normally shown on the internet.

### Building the Case
1. Glue the front and sides together leaving the back pannel unglued. 
2.
