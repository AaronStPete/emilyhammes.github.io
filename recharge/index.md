# Recharge

## Inspiration

This kit was inspired by Markus, a collegue at my local hackspace. Origionally, he devloped an analog circut which looks very similar to this kit. At about the same time, I was giving a workshop in Zurich, and many parents wanted a 15 minute through hole only kit.  With the fusion of these ideas, the Recharge kit was born. 

## Theory

The kit uses a set of charlieplexed LEDs and a button to controll them. Pressing the button wakes up the microcontroller, and the longer the button is held, the more LEDs light up. Once the maximum brighness of the last LED is reached, it begins blinking. 

## Assembly


## Uploading Code

Code comes preuploaded in the kit.
